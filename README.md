## What is this?
This project is a three minute experience about how people with ADHD see the world and live life, specifically in the school environment.
It was designed for the the iPad and developed fully with Swift, using the SwiftUI framework, in about a week or so.

I submitted this project for the WWDC24 Student Challenge. (Please wish me luck)

## Why this?
I am a person diagnosticated with ADHD myself and tried my best to showcase my personal experience when studying for the school tests. In a few words: it wasn't easy. Although many people think that those with this condition are just lazy and that they aren't trying their true best, that's not true at all. We have a different brain chemistry that makes some situations extremely hard and frustrating.

There were many times that I wanted to get up and do what I had to do, but my brain simply didn't allow me and so I sat there, doing absolutely nothing besides think that I was such a disappointment that couldn't do anything. It was only when I found out at 21 years old that I have ADHD that I understood what was happening and how I could better handle those situations. If I had known this information from the start, I'm sure my life would have been a lot easier than it was...

That's the reason for this experience app to exist. I want to do for others what wasn't done for me. I want to improve the life of every child and teenager with ADHD who doesn't know it and thinks they are the problem, that they are a failure and destined to live a life of frustrations and disappointments. I wish to show every parent, teacher or resposible for an ADHD child/teen what is like to live with this condition, how we see the world and interact with it.
